\Abstract{
Lately occupancy modeling has been vastly used as a tool for ecological
research and management planing. However mostly it is used by
interpreting single species models. We present the
\pkg{DiversityOccupancy} in the \proglang{R} environment. The objective
of this package is to simultaneously model factors associated with
occupancy and abundance of individual species using a detection history
file, and to use predicted abundances to calculate species diversity for
each sampling site. The package then models factor(s) associated with
among-site species diversity, which can then be combined with spatial
data to identify areas that contain both high abundance of species of
conservation concern and high species diversity.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\subsection{Single-species or multiple-species
management}\label{single-species-or-multiple-species-management}

The ecological and management literature has usually valued the idea of
managing for diversity. This, however clashes with the classic way in
which conservation takes place. Conservation agencies, goverments,
scientists and international organizations such as IUCN, classify
species according to a conservation status, and policies are made to
safeward the ones that are envisioned as species of conservation
concerned \citep{keller2004red, rodrigues2006value}. Single species are
easier to manage for, and it is easier to keep track the status of a
specie than it is to define management for diversity, it is also more
complicated to sample to keep track of changes in diversity.

There are several aproaches to design management meassures based on
single species, such as using umbrella species
\citep{crosby2015looking, bichet2016maintaining}, Habitat Suitability
Indices \citep{zohmann2013modelling}. Even when the literature mostly
criticizes the use of such aproaches due to the ineffectiveness in
prevent loss of biodiversity
\citep{roberge2004usefulness, branton2011assessing}

One of the problems of managing simple species, is that is usually very
difficult to predict what will happend to other species and because of
that it is hard to predict what will happend to diversity
\citep{pulliam2000relationship}, with some examples showing that even
management meassurements that use some species as umbrella species for
conservation of ecosystems leading to undesired community effects
\citep{white2013conservation}

In this paper we present package \pkg{DiversityOccupancy}, used in the
\proglang{R} environment, The objective of this package is to
simultaneously model factors associated with occupancy and abundance of
individual species using a detection history file, and to use predicted
abundances to calculate species diversity for each sampling site. The
package then models factor(s) associated with among-site species
diversity, which can then be combined with spatial data to identify
areas that contain both high abundance of species of conservation
concern and high species diversity.

Single species conservation methods vs multiple species method,
possibility of using both for taking decisions

In the last decade, Occupancy modeling has been used more and more as a
method to account for how species respond to environmental or
anthropogenic factors. It has also been shown to be useful as a species
distribution modeling tool when species have imperfect detection.
Anthore use for what it has been used is for managers to change the
environment of managed areas in order to improve the status of species
of conservation concern. Unfortunantely this decision usually comes
without taking into account the effect of such management action on
species diversity. There has been several authors championing for the
use of species specific or diversity related approaches to plan
conservation issues, \citep{mackenzie_estimating_2002} but as far as we
know this is the first method that takes into account both species
diversity and individual species abundance in order to select
conservation areas \citep{mackenzie_estimating_2002}.

\subsection{Installing
DiversityOccupancy}\label{installing-diversityoccupancy}

\subsubsection{Requirements}\label{requirements}

To use this package you need \proglang{R} version 3.2.2 or newer (use
the function \code{sessionInfo()} in your R session to check your
current version).

\subsubsection{Installing the package}\label{installing-the-package}

Install from cran repository

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
install.packages("DiversityOccupancy")
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

\subsection{Objectives of the Package}\label{objectives-of-the-package}

\section{Use of the package}\label{use-of-the-package}

In order to calculate abundance and alpha diversity we need at least
three files:

\paragraph{Detection history of multiple
species}\label{detection-history-of-multiple-species}

A data frame consisting on the detection history of at least two
species. As an example \pkg{DiversityOccupancy} has the data-set BatOccu
which contains detection histories of 17 species of bats in the Plumas
National Forest for 3 consecutive days (Columns) in 49 different sites
(Rows). The data set includes a 1 for each time a species was detected,
and a 0 for each time it was not detected.

A detection for the first three species is presented below:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
library(DiversityOccupancy)
data("BatOccu")
head(BatOccu[1:9])
\end{CodeInput}
\begin{CodeOutput}
  Myyu1 Myyu2 Myyu3 Myca1 Myca2 Myca3 Myci1 Myci2 Myci3
1     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0
2     1     0     0     1     0     0     0     0     0
3     0     0     0     0     1     0     0     0     0
4     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0
5     0     0     0     1     1     1     0     0     0
6     1     0     0     1     1     1     0     0     0
\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}

\paragraph{Site covariates}\label{site-covariates}

Site covariates are presented in a data frame consisting of measurements
taken at each site. The covariates are used singly and in combination to
model occupancy or abundance, and they should be variables that are
stable within the scope of the length of the study. In
\pkg{DiversityOccupancy} there is an example concordant with the BatOccu
data set called sampling.cov:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
data("sampling.cov")
head(sampling.cov)
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeOutput}

\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}

\paragraph{Detection covariates}\label{detection-covariates}

A list of data frames, in which each data frame includes a daily
measurement of variables with the potential to affect detection
probabilities. It is important that each element (data frame) of the
list has a name, so that it can be called to fit the occupancy model.
These variables are used to model the probability of detection.

\pkg{DiversityOccupancy} has a data set called \emph{Dailycov} which
illustrates how the Daily covariates have to be structured:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
#All the items of the ist must have names
names(Dailycov)
\end{CodeInput}
\begin{CodeOutput}
[1] "Julian"   "Maxhum"   "Maxtemp"  "Meanhum"  "Meantemp" "Minhum"   "Mintemp" 
[8] "sdhum"    "sdtemp"  
\end{CodeOutput}
\begin{CodeInput}
#here we see the first dataframe of the Dailycov dataset
head(Dailycov[[1]])
\end{CodeInput}
\begin{CodeOutput}
  Julian.Julian1 Julian.Julian2 Julian.Julian3
1      -1.683391      -1.683391      -1.683019
2      -1.620723      -1.620723      -1.620362
3      -1.684443      -1.684443      -1.684071
4      -1.557310      -1.557310      -1.556958
5      -1.429475      -1.429475      -1.434405
6      -1.241253      -1.241253      -1.240951
\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}

\subsection{Fiting models for abundance and predicting alpha
diversity}\label{fiting-models-for-abundance-and-predicting-alpha-diversity}

In this example we will fit and model the abundance for 17 bat species
and calculate alpha diversity from those results.

\textbackslash{}begin\{CodeChunk\} \textbackslash{}begin\{CodeInput\}
BatDiversity \textless{}-diversityoccu(pres = BatOccu, sitecov =
sampling.cov, obscov = Dailycov,spp = 17, form = \textasciitilde{}
Julian + Meanhum \textasciitilde{} Burn.intensity.soil +
I(Burn.intensity.soil\^{}2), dredge = FALSE)
\textbackslash{}end\{CodeInput\} \textbackslash{}end\{CodeChunk\}

The resulting object of class diversityoccupancy has the following
elements

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
names(BatDiversity)
\end{CodeInput}
\begin{CodeOutput}
[1] "Covs"      "models"    "Diversity" "species"  
\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}

If you need to see the parameters of the model of one of the species,
you call the species number with the element\$models. For example
extract the model for the second species:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
BatDiversity$models[[2]]
\end{CodeInput}
\begin{CodeOutput}

Call:
occuRN(formula = form, data = models[[i]])

Abundance:
                          Estimate     SE      z P(>|z|)
(Intercept)               0.000567 0.2829  0.002   0.998
Burn.intensity.soil       0.543374 0.3826  1.420   0.156
I(Burn.intensity.soil^2) -0.092936 0.0996 -0.933   0.351

Detection:
            Estimate    SE      z P(>|z|)
(Intercept)    0.113 0.357  0.317  0.7512
Julian        -0.097 0.267 -0.364  0.7159
Meanhum       -0.548 0.246 -2.228  0.0259

AIC: 180.113 
\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}

The species parameter for a diversityoccupancy object shows us a table with the abundance and alpha diversity calculated for each sampled point:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}

\end{CodeInput}

\subsection{Automatic model selection for abundance
models}\label{automatic-model-selection-for-abundance-models}

If the option of dredge is set to ``TRUE'', then diversityoccu attempts
to fit all first order models, and it selects the one with the lowest
AICc value, for each species. Be aware that processing times rapidly
increases with added numbers of parameters, and that processing can
require many hours or days for complex data sets. The following graph
and table shows the processing time for the BatOccu data set.

From now on we will work with automatically selected models for bat
abundance and diversity using an information theoretic approach (AICc).

\textbackslash{}begin\{CodeChunk\} \textbackslash{}begin\{CodeInput\}
batmodel.selected \textless{}- diversityoccu(pres = BatOccu, sitecov =
sampling.cov, obscov = Dailycov,spp = 17, form = \textasciitilde{}
Julian + Meanhum \textasciitilde{} Burn.intensity.soil +
I(Burn.intensity.soil\^{}2), dredge = TRUE)
\textbackslash{}end\{CodeInput\} \textbackslash{}end\{CodeChunk\}

Below we present an example of an analysis with the full model (includes
all variables) and subsequently results from a model selection analysis,
both of them only for the second species:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
BatDiversity$models[[2]]
\end{CodeInput}
\begin{CodeOutput}

Call:
occuRN(formula = form, data = models[[i]])

Abundance:
                          Estimate     SE      z P(>|z|)
(Intercept)               0.000567 0.2829  0.002   0.998
Burn.intensity.soil       0.543374 0.3826  1.420   0.156
I(Burn.intensity.soil^2) -0.092936 0.0996 -0.933   0.351

Meanhum       -0.548 0.246 -2.228  0.0259

AIC: 180.113 
\end{CodeOutput}
\begin{CodeInput}
batmodel.selected$models[[2]]
\end{CodeInput}
\begin{CodeOutput}

Call:
occuRN(formula = ~Meanhum + 1 ~ Burn.intensity.soil + 1, data = data2)

Abundance:
                    Estimate     SE     z P(>|z|)
(Intercept)           0.0767 0.2637 0.291  0.7712
Burn.intensity.soil   0.1901 0.0973 1.953  0.0508

Detection:
            Estimate    SE      z P(>|z|)
(Intercept)    0.143 0.351  0.407  0.6840
Meanhum       -0.530 0.242 -2.190  0.0285

AIC: 177.0765 
\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}

The responses of individual species to specific variables can be shown
using the function respnseplot.abund, bellow we show the response of
abundance in species 2 to the Burn intensity soil. Note that this
function automatically bounds the limits of the variable to the maximum
and minimum observable values in the field.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
responseplot.abund(batmodel.selected, spp = 2, variable = Burn.intensity.soil)
\end{CodeInput}

\subsection{Model selection for alpha diversity
modeling}\label{model-selection-for-alpha-diversity-modeling}

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

The \pkg{DiversityOccupancy} package lets scientists and managers take
dessitions based on species information, diversity information or both.
In some countries, laws require that the decision is taken based on
endangered species information, the possibility on selecting an area, or
manage environments based on both diversity and species specific
information, gives a possibility to managers or decision makers wanting
to use diversity with laws requiring them to take species into account.
